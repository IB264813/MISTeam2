<p>Centric Consulting wants to acknowledge when our employees do something that match our core values. To ensure employee knows that they are valued, we have created a rewards system that will keep track of every time that they went above and beyond to meet our core value standard. This rewards system will give the opportunity for fellow employees, managers, and any other Centric individual to recognize when someone has followed the positive direction Centric drives to create.<p/>
